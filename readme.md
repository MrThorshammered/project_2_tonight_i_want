------Tonight I want----------

The project brief was to build our first proper rails app. I decided to go with something that I would use in my day to day life and built a recipe cook book. Within this app you can select recipes by country or through a simple search with the ingredients that you already have. It is meant to be used as a collection of recipes in one place instead of spread out through a load of cook books. It is meant to make it easier to pick and find recipes and to make it easier for people to eat healthier.
